## About Me

I build backend systems using Python, with experience across Django, Flask, and FastAPI.  
My work includes REST APIs, CRUD-based applications, and data-processing scripts using SQL and pandas.

I care about clean logic, maintainable code, and understanding problems deeply instead of chasing buzzwords.

If something breaks, I debug it.  
If something is slow, I profile it.  
If something is unclear, I simplify it.
