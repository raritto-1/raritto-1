## About Me

I build backend systems and data-focused applications using Python. I’ve worked with Django, Flask, FastAPI, SQL, and pandas, and I’m comfortable moving between web backends and data-processing scripts. I don’t chase buzzwords—I focus on writing code that actually works and can be extended without turning into a mess.

If something is broken, I debug it. If something is slow, I profile it. If something is unclear, I simplify it.

If you’re looking for flashy buzzwords, this profile isn’t it. If you’re looking for someone who actually writes and fixes code, you’re in the right place.
